## Overview

This was my **second group project**, built in Unity with C#.
The theme was *twin-stick shooter*, and our concept was a **bank heist** where players could choose between **stealth or chaos**. The objective: steal as much loot as possible and escape the police.

- **Team size:** 4 (2 artists, 1 other developer, and me)
- **Development time:** ~2 months

## Key features:
- Responsive **twin-stick shooting & movement**
- **Interactable objects** (doors, pickups, cameras)
- **Randomized loot system** with weight restrictions
- Player choice between **stealthy heist or full shootout**

## My Contributions

### ðŸ”¹ Object Interaction System
I built a system for interacting with objects like pickups and doors.
- Made it **modular and easy to extend** so new objects can be added without rewriting code.
- My first time working with **interfaces** in Unity, which helped me learn clean coding practices.

```csharp:IInteractable.cs
public interface IInteractable
{
    public string popupText { get; set; }
    public float interactionTime { get; set; }
    public InventoryItemData requiredItem { get; set; }

    public GameEvent onExitInteractableRange { get; set; }
    public GameEvent onEnterInteractableRange { get; set; }
    public GameEvent onInteract { get; set; }

    public void Interact();
    public bool CanInteract();
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Loot System
I implemented the loot generation system for safes and containers.
- Each safe has its own loot table, so locations feel different.
- Loot is randomized (cash and weight) with different value vs. weight trade-offs.
- Player inventory has a weight cap, so players must choose carefully.
```csharp:SafeLootData.cs
public class SafeLootData : ScriptableObject
{
    public string name;
    public GameObject lootObject;
    public string id;
    public float value;
    public float weight;
    public float interactionTime;

}
```

## Challenges and Learnings

I had to leave the project early for medical reasons. This gave the other programmer extra work, and the project wasnâ€™t finished on time.

From this, I learned:
- Good communication is very important in team projects.
- Sharing tasks helps avoid problems if someone leaves.
- Modular systems make projects easier to continue, even if team members change.

Even though it didnâ€™t finish, I gained a lot of Unity experience and learned how to build flexible systems.

## End Result
