          Hey, I’m Silvano! I’m 19 and in my fourth year of Game Development at Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht. I love creating complex systems that crack my brain and push me to think in new ways. AI and game development are where I get to explore that curiosity, and I’m always looking to learn more, experiment, and grow through every project I work on.
